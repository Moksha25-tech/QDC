# Quadrature Down Converter (QDC) Design and Simulation

Individually designed and simulated a complete **Quadrature Down Converter (QDC)** using **LTSpice**, as part of a broader exploration into RF and analog front-end circuit design.  
The QDC is a critical component in communication receivers, used to translate a high-frequency RF signal down to baseband while preserving both amplitude and phase information through the generation of in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) signals.

## 🛠️ Project Involvement

The project involved:
- Designing the **Local Oscillator (LO)**.
- Implementing accurate **90° phase-shifted LO paths**.
- Integrating **double-balanced mixers** to achieve proper downconversion.

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

- **Phase Accuracy**: Achieved precise 90-degree phase shift between I and Q paths to ensure accurate demodulation.  
- **Signal Integrity**: Designed filtering stages to suppress unwanted frequency components and improve signal clarity.  
- **Low Phase Noise**: Optimized oscillator design for stability and minimal jitter to maintain signal quality.  
- **System-Level Simulation**: Verified complete QDC behavior using transient and frequency-domain analysis in LTSpice.

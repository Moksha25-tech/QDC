    <h1>Quadrature Down Converter (QDC) Design and Simulation</h1>

    <p>
        Individually designed and simulated a complete <span class="highlight">Quadrature Down Converter (QDC)</span> using LTSpice, 
        as part of a broader exploration into RF and analog front-end circuit design. The QDC is a critical component in 
        communication receivers, used to translate a high-frequency RF signal down to baseband while preserving both amplitude 
        and phase information through the generation of in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) signals.
    </p>

    <p>The project involved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Local Oscillator (LO) Design</span>: Implemented accurate 90Â° phase-shifted LO paths.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Double-Balanced Mixers</span>: Integrated to achieve proper downconversion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key focus areas included:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase Accuracy:</strong> Achieved precise 90-degree phase shift between I and Q paths to ensure accurate demodulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Signal Integrity:</strong> Designed filtering stages to suppress unwanted frequency components and improve signal clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Phase Noise:</strong> Optimized oscillator design for stability and minimal jitter to maintain signal quality.</li>
        <li><strong>System-Level Simulation:</strong> Verified complete QDC behavior using transient and frequency-domain analysis in LTSpice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This hands-on project deepened understanding of RF circuit blocks, frequency translation, and analog signal processing.
